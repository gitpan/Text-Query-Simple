NAME
    Text::Query::Simple - Match text against simple query expression
    and return relevance value for ranking

SYNOPSIS
        use Text::Query::Simple;
        
        # Constructor
        $query = Text::Query::Simple->new([QSTRING] [OPTIONS]);

        # Methods
        $query->prepare(QSTRING [OPTIONS]);
        $query->match([TARGET] [OPTIONS]);

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides an object that tests a string or list of
    strings against a query expression similar to an AltaVista
    "simple query" and returns a "relevance value." Elements of the
    query expression may be regular expressions or literal text.

    Query expressions are compiled into an internal form when a new
    object is created or the `prepare' method is called; they are
    not recompiled on each match.

    Query expressions consist of words (sequences of non-
    whitespace), regexps or phrases (quoted strings) separated by
    whitespace. Words or phrases prefixed with a `+' must be present
    for the expression to match; words or phrases prefixed with a `-
    ' must be absent for the expression to match.

    A successful match returns a count of the number of times any of
    the words (except ones prefixed with `-') appeared in the text.
    This type of result is useful for ranking documents according to
    relevance.

    A word or phrase may be followed by a number in parentheses; this 
    specifies a weight to be given it.

INSTALLATION
    This module is pure Perl, so you can simply copy it into the 
    appropriate directory.

RESTRICTIONS
    This module requires Perl 5.005 or higher.
